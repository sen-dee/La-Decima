        <h1>For HP and Dee... for Us.</h1>
        <p>The other day, I was thinking about when I started to realize how much I needed you, and my mind didn't pinpoint a single moment. Instead, it went to a hundred little moments, starting back in Bay 13.</p>
        <p>It was the coffees at our Same Place. Java Grind. It was us fighting your Airtel network. It was the shopping, the comfortable shared silences, the bumpy auto rides, and the noisy bus routes. It was the arcade playtime, getting caught in the rains with that single useless umbrella, and the late-night talks that made us feel like the only two people in a city of millions.</p>
        <p>And then also that night in 2015. The city was humming in the streets below, but it felt like Bombay held its breath just for us.</p>
        <p>We've grown so much since then, but the magic of spending time with you in Bombay will never get old. Let's go recreate a few of those magic bits. I promise we'll not trip over any potholes. It's our day, and I can't wait to spend every second of it with you.</p>
